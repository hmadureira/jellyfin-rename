echo # jellyfin-rename

how to use:
call the script "altera_nome_season.sh" with the folder containing all the files you want to rename

example:

./altera_nome_season.sh /storage/animes/cdz/

as default the script will first show the result of that on terminal. 
If everything looks good, you'll need to edit the script and uncomment the lines that actually "mv" that will actually rename the files and save them on the given folder
